% RANDOM MEASUREMENT DIRECTIONS TO OPTIMIZE RANDOM DENSITY MATRIX

% Author: Antti SÃ¤llinen
% Last update: 2.7.2020

% This function triggers the solver and then calculates and plots the
% fidelity (closeness of two quantum states) with every iteration step.
% The solver itself optimizes the density matrix with restrictions that are
% randomly obtained.

% Needed scripts to operate: RDM_parempi.m, fmincon_rand.m, nlcon_rand.m,
%                           paulimatrices.m, optimized_rho_rand.m &
%                           to_optimize.m
% Needed toolboxes to operate: Optimization Toolbox

% There is six variables:
%   wanted_measurements: vector that contains the numbers of measurements 
%                        thet one wants to use for measurement amounts.
%   repeats: amount of the times this script generates new random density
%            matrix and tries to optimize it (natural number, default: 1)
%   qubits: amount of qubits to use (natural number, default: 1)
%   ranknum: rank of the density matrix (natural number, default: 1)
%   real: defines if the density matrix is real or complex valued
%         (real valued = 1, complex valued = 0, default: 1)
%   rounds: number of sets to be generated in different amount of 
%           random measurements
